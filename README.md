# sm_tools - Combining observational data and numerical models to obtain a seamless high temporal resolution seasonal cycle of snow and ice mass balance at the MOSAiC Central Observatory

Tools for working with the transect data to prepare input for SnowModel and then to anlyze the model output. 

The data (case) used in this code is from MOSAiC sea ice drift from October 2019 to July 2020.

The SnowModel code is published in a separate repository:
